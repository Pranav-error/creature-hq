# Creature HQ

**Live:** https://creature-hq.web.app

A fullstack developer roadmap where passing quizzes and shipping projects grows a creature companion.
Hosted on Firebase: sign-in with Firebase Auth (Google + email/password), one Firestore document per player.

## Layout

For a detailed map (runtime flow, `game.js` sections, data model, known issues) see [MAP.md](MAP.md).


| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `public/index.html` | Landing page (indexed by search engines). Generated. |
| `public/app.html` | The game, served at `/app` (noindex). Generated. |
| `public/privacy.html`, `public/404.html` | Generated. |
| `public/assets/game.js` | Game code (was the inline scripts of v13). Edit this. |
| `public/assets/quiz.js` | Quiz bank, 5 questions × 177 checkpoints. |
| `public/assets/sync.js` | Sign-in screen + cloud save. Loads the save into localStorage, then starts the game. |
| `public/assets/firebase-config.js` | Public web config for the Firebase project. |
| `firestore.rules` | Only the signed-in owner can read/write `users/{uid}`; everything else is closed. |
| `tools/build-site.mjs` | Regenerates landing/privacy/404/sitemap/robots/manifest. |
| `tools/build-app.mjs` | Regenerates `app.html` from `tools/body.html`. |
| `tools/checkquiz.mjs` | Checks every checkpoint has 5 valid quiz questions. |
| `public/assets/workshop.js` | The Workshop: project gallery, editor, live preview and console. |
| `public/assets/editor.js` | CodeMirror 6, bundled from `tools/editor-entry.js` by `npm run build:editor`. |
| `public-run/index.html` | The preview runner, deployed to its own site (creature-hq-run.web.app). |
| `tools/body.html` | App shell markup that `build-app.mjs` wraps into `app.html`. |

## The Workshop

An HTML/CSS/JavaScript editor with a live preview. Quests from phases 1–4 (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, APIs) can be built in it. Each project is its own Firestore document, `users/{uid}/projects/{id}`, holding three files of up to 100 KB each (enforced in `firestore.rules`).

Student code never runs on creature-hq.web.app. The preview is an iframe of **creature-hq-run.web.app**, a separate Firebase Hosting site. The app sends the files with `postMessage`, the runner writes them into a fresh page and reports `console` output and errors back, labelled `script.js:<line>`. Because it's a different site:

- the code can't read the app's sign-in token or saved data;
- it runs in its own browser process, so an endless loop can't freeze the app (the Workshop notices after a few seconds and pauses auto-run);
- `localStorage` and `fetch` work like on a real web page, which the roadmap's JavaScript and API quests need.

## How saving works

The game still reads and writes its own localStorage keys. `sync.js`:

1. Waits for sign-in, then reads `users/{uid}` and writes it into localStorage before loading `game.js`.
2. After every game `save()`, writes the whole save back (1.5 s debounce, flushed when the tab is hidden or closed).
3. Keeps a revision number. If this device has changes the server never got (closed while offline), they're pushed on the next load; if another device saved something newer, that wins.
4. If another tab or device saves while this one is open, this tab stops saving and asks you to reload, so older progress never overwrites newer progress.

## Commands

```bash
# rebuild pages after changing game data or copy (SITE = the public URL)
SITE=https://creature-hq.web.app node tools/build-site.mjs

# local preview in test mode (no sign-in) while firebase-config.js is blank
npx serve public

# local preview against emulators (needs Java): copy tools/demo-config.js over public/assets/firebase-config.js, then
npx firebase-tools emulators:start --only auth,firestore --project demo-creature-hq

# rebuild the editor bundle after changing tools/editor-entry.js
npm install && npm run build:editor

# local preview: app on 5173, runner on 5174 (open the app at http://127.0.0.1:5173)
npx serve public -l 5173
npx serve public-run -l 5174

# deploy (app, runner and database rules)
npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting,firestore:rules --project creature-hq
```

Bump `?v=16` everywhere it appears (`tools/build-app.mjs`, `tools/build-site.mjs`, `public/assets/sync.js`, `public/assets/workshop.js`) when you change assets, so browsers fetch the new files. `grep -rn 'v=16' public/assets tools` finds them all.

## Bugs fixed from v13

- Importing a backup (or loading a save) with a damaged companion could crash the pantry and stats; companions are now repaired on load (`cleanPet`).
- The floating window's feed button crashed if the companion was deleted while it was open; resetting progress now also closes the floating window.
- Opening a project in the Proof vault whose checkpoint no longer exists crashed; now ignored.
- Typing ↑↑↑↓↓←→←→BA (an extra ↑) didn't trigger the cheat code.
- Notes typed right before closing the tab on mobile could be lost (`pagehide` now flushes them).
- Export didn't include sound and focus-length settings; import now restores them.
