# Creature HQ

**Live:** https://creature-hq.web.app

A fullstack developer roadmap where passing quizzes and shipping projects grows a creature companion.
Hosted on Firebase: sign-in with Firebase Auth (Google + email/password), one Firestore document per player.

## Layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `public/index.html` | Landing page (indexed by search engines). Generated. |
| `public/app.html` | The game, served at `/app` (noindex). Generated. |
| `public/privacy.html`, `public/404.html` | Generated. |
| `public/assets/game.js` | Game code (was the inline scripts of v13). Edit this. |
| `public/assets/quiz.js` | Quiz bank, 5 questions × 177 checkpoints. |
| `public/assets/sync.js` | Sign-in screen + cloud save. Loads the save into localStorage, then starts the game. |
| `public/assets/firebase-config.js` | Public web config for the Firebase project. |
| `firestore.rules` | Only the signed-in owner can read/write `users/{uid}`; everything else is closed. |
| `tools/build-site.mjs` | Regenerates landing/privacy/404/sitemap/robots/manifest. |
| `tools/build-app.mjs` | Regenerates `app.html` from `tools/body.html`. |
| `tools/checkquiz.mjs` | Checks every checkpoint has 5 valid quiz questions. |

## How saving works

The game still reads and writes its own localStorage keys. `sync.js`:

1. Waits for sign-in, then reads `users/{uid}` and writes it into localStorage before loading `game.js`.
2. After every game `save()`, writes the whole save back (1.5 s debounce, flushed when the tab is hidden or closed).
3. Keeps a revision number. If this device has changes the server never got (closed while offline), they're pushed on the next load; if another device saved something newer, that wins.
4. If another tab or device saves while this one is open, this tab stops saving and asks you to reload, so older progress never overwrites newer progress.

## Commands

```bash
# rebuild pages after changing game data or copy (SITE = the public URL)
SITE=https://creature-hq.web.app node tools/build-site.mjs

# local preview in test mode (no sign-in) while firebase-config.js is blank
npx serve public

# local preview against emulators (needs Java): copy tools/demo-config.js over public/assets/firebase-config.js, then
npx firebase-tools emulators:start --only auth,firestore --project demo-creature-hq

# deploy
npx firebase-tools deploy --only hosting,firestore:rules --project <project-id>
```

Bump `?v=14` in `tools/build-app.mjs`, `tools/build-site.mjs` and `sync.js` when you change assets, so browsers fetch the new files.

## Bugs fixed from v13

- Importing a backup (or loading a save) with a damaged companion could crash the pantry and stats; companions are now repaired on load (`cleanPet`).
- The floating window's feed button crashed if the companion was deleted while it was open; resetting progress now also closes the floating window.
- Opening a project in the Proof vault whose checkpoint no longer exists crashed; now ignored.
- Typing ↑↑↑↓↓←→←→BA (an extra ↑) didn't trigger the cheat code.
- Notes typed right before closing the tab on mobile could be lost (`pagehide` now flushes them).
- Export didn't include sound and focus-length settings; import now restores them.
